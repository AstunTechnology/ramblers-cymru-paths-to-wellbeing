## Putting walking at the hearts of communities 

### Improving access to  in Wales 
Ramblers Cymruâ€™s Paths to Wellbeing project is a great example of how the Ramblers open the way for everyone to enjoy the simple pleasures of walking in nature.  The project puts walking at the heart of 18 communities across Wales by giving them the tools and training to improve nature and access to walking in their local areas.  

We are giving the selected communities the free tools and training needed to identify and design new walking routes and to improve existing routes.

Together with 22 local authorities, Wildlife Trust Wales and Coed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales we will also be enhancing the local environment for nature to thrive. With activities such as tree planting, wildflower sowing and wildlife activity days, there will be plenty of activities for those of all ages and backgrounds. 

### Led by the community, for the community 
Ramblers Cymru believes that community engagement with paths and green spaces will be strengthened by investing in upskilling, equipping, supporting, and leading local volunteers to manage and undertake practical path and habitat maintenance and improvements. Ultimately this will connect people to the health and wellbeing benefits of nature and walking. 

We are working with local volunteers and community members to deliver their community needs. Those taking part will gain new skills with expert support and guidance from Ramblers Cymru and our partners.
